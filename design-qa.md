# Product Design QA

final result: blocked

## Scope

- Target page: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Selected reference: Product Design option 3, "Immersive Model First"
- Reference image: `/Users/luckyzaizai/.codex/generated_images/019f215d-38bf-7213-9a19-05af96eae4f1/ig_01b23a1ccbd7c64c016a45febc49448199885ac3b51c4a0056.png`
- Implemented page source: `src/components/LandingPage.tsx`

## Implemented

- Hero is now model-first with a full-bleed generated rebar visualization asset.
- Left-side headline, value copy, AI generation input, sample prompts, and CTA actions match the selected direction.
- Header now includes landing-specific actions for AI assistant, GitHub, and start learning.
- Added capability strip below hero and a first-row component launcher.
- Preserved existing functional interactions: AI prompt routing, image scan entry, CTA links, component links, and existing downstream sections.
- Second pass: reduced first-screen height so the component launcher is visible sooner, added the vertical viewport tool rail, added model thumbnails to the component launcher, and rethemed the stats, features, component library, and AI assistant sections to match the same engineering dark-mode language.

## Asset QA

- Generated source asset: `public/landing-rebar-hero.png`
- Optimized runtime asset: `public/landing-rebar-hero.webp`
- WebP size: 137 KB
- The hero uses `next/image` with `priority` and `sizes="100vw"`.

## Automated Checks

- `npm run lint`: passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Dev server: running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Blocking Issue

The environment did not expose a usable in-app browser screenshot or browser-control tool for the current page. A system screenshot attempt captured the Codex image preview instead of the local webpage, so a same-viewport visual comparison between the selected reference image and the implemented page could not be completed honestly.

## Follow-Up

To move this QA from blocked to passed, capture the current `http://localhost:3000/` viewport in the in-app browser and compare it against the selected reference image at the same viewport state.
